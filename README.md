# ACC_SearchEngine_Thymeleaf v1.0

Added front end to ACC_Search_Engine with further enhancements.
Based completely on Spring-frameweork using the Thymeleaf library.
Backend processing is implemented using Jsoup.
Code for web scraping has been referenced, while the code for algorithms in this project are available as open source.

To run this project, simply run the "AccSearchEngineThymeleafApplication.java" from the main method,
and navigate to the localhost port number where the application is hosted. This is a simple working model of a Search Engine
built for academic purposes.

Needs improvement and fixes-
1) CSS needs to be added
2) Bootstrap needs to be added
3) Bug in search text box needs to be fixed
4) Optional feature is pending
5) URLs are redirecting to the search page
